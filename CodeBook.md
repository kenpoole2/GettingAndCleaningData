The dimensions of the output data set ar 180 rows by 68 columns.
there are 30 subject and 6 activitys ==> 30 * 6 = 180 observations.

Output Feature List

"subjects"       - Indicates a specific individual. Sequence of values 1:30
"activity_label" - Activity being performed during the observation. Values: standing, walking, sitting, 
                   laying, Walking Upstairs, and walking downstairs

The remaining features are the means and standard deviations of the observations for each subject and activity combination for all of the measurements listed below. Those measurements marked by XYZ have separate measurements for the X, Y, and Z axes. We only kept the mean and standard deviation measuremnts of the orginal source data. We then summarized the measurements by taking the mean of the means and the mean of the standard deviations. The full feature list is available at the end of this document.
Note that there are 33 features listed below "-XYZ" counts as 3. We kept 2 measurements of each feature, the mean and standard deviation ==> 33 * 2 = 66 measurements.

All measurements are numeric values in the range [-1,1]

About the Source Data
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
